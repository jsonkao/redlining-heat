The Makefile (`/data/Makefile`) handles all data processing. It has the following functions.

0. Uses mapshaper to create necessary prerequisite files: `city-bbox-index.json` (maps city to bounding box), `city-boundaries.json` (maps city to dissolved bounary).

1. It generates a basemap for each city. `scripts/download-osm.sh` downloads vector data from OSM via the Overpass API into `OSM_DIR`. `scripts/xml2geojson.py` converts the data into GeoJSON (`OSM_GEO_DIR`). GDAL burns the vectors into a web-friendly raster (`OSM_BURNED_DIR`). `scripts/project.py` applies a local Albers projection and converts the raster into a PNG.

2. It generates a temperature layers for each city. I use the GEE JavaScript API to download a temperature layer for each city's bounding box into `TEMP_DIR`. I convert it (`gdaldem color-relief`) into a colored relief (`RELIEF_DIR`). `scripts/create-color-config.py` makes a custom color configuration (`COLOR_DIR`) for each temperature raster that only considers values inside a city's boundary. `scripts/project.py` applies an Albers projection and converts the raster into a PNG.

3. It generates city-level HOLC boundary SVGs into `HOLC_DIR` using the Mapping Inequality shapefile (I downloaded the compressed data from [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/40.809/-74.187&Ëœcity=manhattan-ny&area=D3&text=intro), unzipped it, and kept only the `shapefile` directory, which I renamed to `holc-shapefile`). It uses [`-split holc_grade`](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-split) to group polygons into `<g>`'s. It uses mapshaper to project the SVG according to the string produced by `scripts/project.py --just-proj`.

4. It extracts the essentials from GEE task exports with ndjson-cli into `temperatures-YYYY.json`.

5. It takes the GEE task export and uses the R script `./r/runTukey.r` to run the Tukey HSD test on all cities. The script also generates Tukey and density plot visualizations for all cities.

Latest benchmarks with 19 cities, including NYC and LA, without OSM download time:
```
make basemaps  484.17s user 11.69s system 181% cpu 4:32.91 total
make tempmaps  218.55s user 35.39s system 137% cpu 3:04.54 total
```

These benchmarks were made before I projected everything. I use right now bilinear resampling, but it's really slow, and I could just go back to the default resampling.

## Instructions

To add new cities, append them to the `CITIES` variable in the Makefile. Run `make check-unique` to make sure there are no duplicate cities. Run `make downloads` (may have to run several times to get over the 429's). Run `make all`.

Prerequisites:
* Command line: GDAL, Python GDAL/OGR, jq, mapshaper, ndjson-cli, R, Node
* Files: [`data/scripts/privatekey.json`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/service_account)
* Libraries: `npm install`, `osgeo` for Python

## Next Steps

* Policy analysis

* Trees, impervious surfaces, what else?
